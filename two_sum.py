# Problem: Two Sum
# Difficulty: Easy
# Approach: HashMap (single pass)
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
#
# Problem Statement:
# Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of
# the two numbers that add up to the target.

def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Uses a hashmap to store complement of each number.
    For each number, check if its complement already exists.
    """
    seen = {}  # value -> index

        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i

    return []  # no solution found
